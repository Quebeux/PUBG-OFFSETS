# PUBG-OFFSETS

A list of auto generated offsets extracted from [TJ888](https://github.com/TJ888/PUBG-SDK)'s SDK to use in an external "tool"

Just reference these in your project and instead of manually updating offsets everytime they change, just overwrite the files with the new one. 

These will be updated as soon as there's a new SDK available.
